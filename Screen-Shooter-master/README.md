### Camera

You need to specify from which camera you want to take screenshots. The first enabled camera tagged "MainCamera" is selected by default.

### Screenshots Configuration

With **ScreehShooter** multiple screenshots can be taken with a single click. For each screenshot, you can specify desired name, resolution and file format (JPG or PNG).

You can do that manually or use predefined values from the dropdown menu:

### Tag

The tag is just a convenient way to specify common file name prefix for all screenshots that will be taken with one click. While this field is not required, it can save time in case you need to make few different sets of screenshots with the same configuration.

### Save To

Screenshots will be saved to `%YOUR_PROJECT%/Screenshots` folder by default. If you want to change the save path, click on **Browse** button and choose another folder, or enter the new path manually.

If target folder already exists then **Show** button will be enabled. You can use this button to open screenshots folder directly in system file manager.

If target folder doesn’t exist yet, it will be created when taking screenshots.

### Take Screenshots

Finally, you’re now able to take as many screenshots as you want, simply by pressing the **Take Screenshots** button! Also, you can do that by using the **Alt+Shift+S** keyboard shortcut.

**Please note:** There is currently a known bug within Unity itself preventing *"Screen space - Overlay"* UI items from being captured. Once Unity's Developers fix this bug UI elements should be captured correctly. As a workaround you can switch canvas render mode to *"Screen Space - Camera"* and set canvas plane distance close to camera near clipping plane.

### Folder Location

The “ScreenShoter” folder doesn’t require to be in the root of your project, you can freely  move it wherever you want.  Then just go to **Edit -> Preferences -> ScreenShooter** and update the folder location:
